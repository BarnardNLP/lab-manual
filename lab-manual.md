# Text Processing Lab Manual

This is an introduction to carrying out research in the Text Processing
Lab. It describes our general approach to research and your rights and
responsibilities as a researcher, whether that's for a summer, a semester,
or multiple years.

If you don't understand something in this manual, ask for help! Either
you'll learn something or the manual needs to be corrected.


## Rights and responsibilities

Your rights as a lab member:

- You are entitled to a safe work environment, free from harassment,
  abuse, violence, and discrimination in any form.

- You are entitled to be supported and respected by all lab members.

- You are entitled to openly share your scientific ideas and constructive
  feedback with all lab members.

- You are entitled to appropriate credit (authorship, acknowledgment,
  letter of recommendation) for your work and ideas.


Your responsibilities as a lab member:

- You agree to contribute to a safe work environment and to refrain from
  behaviors that harass, abuse, expose to violence, or discriminate.

- You agree to support and respect all lab members, including yourself.

- You agree to openly share your scientific ideas and constructive
  feedback with other lab members.

- You agree to clearly communicate and document your contributions to each
  research project, e.g., through GitHub commit messages, README files,
  emails, etc.

- You agree to establish open lines of communication between yourself and
  other lab members and to address concerns or issues promptly and
  directly with the relevant parties (to the extent that you feel safe
  doing so).

- You agree to carry out your work with integrity and diligence, adhering
  to the standards of scientific excellence.


If you feel that your rights as a lab member have been -- or are in danger
of being -- violated, it is your duty to report those violations to an
appropriate person, e.g., Jonathan, the chair of the Computer Science
Department, the Dean of Studies, the Title IX coordinator, etc. Similarly,
if you notice others endangering others' rights or neglecting their
responsibilities, it is your duty to report those violations.


## Who to go to with questions

Technical issues can often be resolved within the lab, but some will
require outside help. Interpersonal issues should be resolved in
accordance with your comfort, but it is important to be aware of the below
resources should you encounter a situation in which you want to use them.

- If you have a question about the lab policies or practices, first try to
  find the answer in this lab manual!

- If you feel your question is not adequately answered in the lab manual,
  post your question on Slack or talk to Jonathan.

- For questions on papers or posters, talk to Jonathan.

- For issues with equipment owned by the CS department or with the Hopper
  cluster, you should contact Matt Tarantino, mtarantino@vassar.edu.

- For issues with Vassar IT, open a [service
  ticket](http://servicedesk.vassar.edu).

- For questions about forms, receipts, etc., contact Jennie Colabella,
  jcolabella@vassar.edu.
